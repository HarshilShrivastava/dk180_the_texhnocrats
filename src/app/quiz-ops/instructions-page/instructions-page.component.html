            <li>You can attempt this quiz even without signing up on our portal. However for viewing and applying for recommended jobs, you should have an account with us</li>
             <li>The quiz consists of 3 rounds as follows:

                             <div class="btm-boder-txt">
                             In this round your knowledge in top level domains will be tested (Domains currently on our portal are technology and marketing). Your best performing domain will be forwarded to round 2 (say Domain X) 
                             Also you need to cross a threshold of 70% in a domain in this round for it to be your best performing domain, if not you will be asked to re-attempt round 1

                             <div class="btm-boder-txt">
                             This round will test your knowledge in the sub-domains of Domain X. As of now, we have 4 sub domains for technology and marketing each.
                             The 2 subdomains in which you perform best will be considered for the final round. Again, the threshold of 70% needs to be crossed in each of the top 2 sub-domains. If not, you will be redirected to the 2nd round of the 2nd best domain of round 1 (Eg: If in round 2, you could not clear the threshold for tech sub-domains you will be redirected to round 2 of marketing domain)

The reason we need to be so thorough is because post this round, you will be recommended jobs based on the marks you score here.
