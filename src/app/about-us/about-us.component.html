    Almost 60% of the youth who are employed in the country are unhappy with
    their present jobs. This in turn makes the employer unhappy as stuns the
    company's growth. We believe that the root cause of this is that people are
    pushed into roles which are not suitable for them. Hence we take a holistic
    approach to assess a candidate's profile.

    Our portal is designed in way to access the skill set and capacity of the
    Appplicant accurately and recommend jobs to the suitable candidate against a
    requirement from the industry.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The best way to access an applicant's inclination towards a particular
    domain is not just by looking at their resume. This is why along with the
    resume we ask the candidate to answer relevant questions which can be
    processed to give factual data.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Our assessment consists of three rounds. The first round is a generic round
    to determine which domain the candidate would excel the most at. The next
    round has questions on the domain that got selected in the previous round.
    Here, knowledge of all the sub domains are tested and the top two sub
    domains are taken into consideration for the third and final round.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Along with the quiz, we also have a chatbot which acts as a Career
    Counsellor. The applicants who are extremely confused about which path they
    should choose can interact with the chatbot and get their queries resolved.
